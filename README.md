# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
- This application is the 11th module project that focused on what we learned about Express.js. 
- Allowed me to practice using get, post, and delete for back end development.
- We are deploying our application on Heroku which allows me to practice using Heroku over deploying on Github.
- Github repo: https://github.com/devonforyou/Note-Taker
